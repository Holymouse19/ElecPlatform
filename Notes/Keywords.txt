TSO - Transmission System Operators
Entities responsible for operating and maintainning the electricity transmission grids within a country / region

NEMOs - Nominated Electricity Market Operators
Entities designated to perform tasks related to day-ahead + intraday coupling, ie. collecting bids and offers from market participants.

MCO - Market Coupling Operator
Joint task performed by NEMOs to match electricity bids and offers, alocated cross-border capacity using a special algorithm.

Cross-Zonal Capacity
Amount of electricity that can be exchanged between different bidding zones

Bidding zone
Region of electricity trade. defined to manage congestion efficiently

Flow-Based Calculation Method
method for calculating cross-zonal capacity
Optimized for highly interdependent grids

Coordinated Net Transmission Capacity Approach
method for calculating capacity
used in regions where cross-zonal capacity is less interdependent

Commong Grid Model
Union-wide dataset that describes main characteristics of the power system, including generation, loads, and grid layout.




Simplified workflow:
1. Capacity Calc
TSOs Work together to calculate the available cross-border capacity for the day-ahead and intraday markets. This involves creating a common grid model that estimates generation, load and network status.


2. Order submission
Market participants submit their bids and offers for electricity to NEMOs

3. Market Coupling:
NEMOs, performing the MCO function, use algorithms(price coupling for day-ahead, continous trading matching for intraday)
to match these bids and offers across the EU, taking into account the available cross-zonal capacity.
The goal is to maximize the economic benefit.

4. Price determination
The algorithm determine a single cleaing price for each bidding zone and the net position(total import or exports) for each zone.

5. Results and Transfer
The results are sent to TSOs and NEMOs, and the electricity is then transferred across the network according to the matched trades. 

6. Fallback procedures
If the main market coupling process fails, backup orcedures are in place to ensure capacity can still be allocated

7. Cost recovery
Costs incurred by TSOs and NEMOs in setting up and operating these systems are recovered through  network tariffs or fees.
